# data-over-audio
- Encode and decode data over audio waves, a utility tool written in Python 3.
- Tested on windows.
- Encoder and decoder must possess matching synchronizer configuration.
- Transmission config is susceptible to system configuration (speakers and mic).
- See frequency testing log for tested configurations and param ranges.
- for usage, see examples.
